# 3 Dataset Shape
    (45222, 10) for 2020. 15 csv files total.


# 4 Describe the fields
    How many categorical fields? What do they represent? Six categorical fields but I think it should be eight to include the year(same for each csv) and month.

    How many quantitative? What do they represent? Age and police

    Is there missing data or data that seems to be wrong somehow (e.g. age = -99)?
    -There are some NaN and other specified values for the Place column.

    Has the data already been summarized, or are the observations raw and unprocessed?
        -I believe it is unprocessed


# 5 Potential avenues of inquiry
    Initial data exploration often sparks additional questions or potential insights that could be supported by continued exploration.

    What types of questions does this dataset seem to support?
    -Could do a breakdown of gun deaths per month over however many years(1-15) looking for deadliest month/year. Maybe if education level reduces risk of non suicide death and then compare to suicide death. It wound be interesting to look at death rate pre, during, and post COVID if they were available.

    Be especially on the lookout for avenues of inquiry that produce a tangible value (the ability to make better targeted or informed decisions, or some other potential benefit to stakeholders).

# 6 Value proposition
    Imagine that this dataset was provided by some stakeholder.

    What are the potential benefits to your proposed line of inquiry? It's ok if this adjusts as you become more acquainted with the data.
     -Potentially finding the at risk of suicide groups and targeting them for suicide prevention and outreach programs.
